[exp-14-46:mpi_rank_0][rdma_param_handle_heterogeneity] All nodes involved in the job were detected to be homogeneous in terms of processors and interconnects. Setting MV2_HOMOGENEOUS_CLUSTER=1 can improve job startup performance on such systems. The following link has more details on enhancing job startup performance. http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/performance/job-startup/.
[exp-14-46:mpi_rank_0][rdma_param_handle_heterogeneity] To suppress this warning, please set MV2_SUPPRESS_JOB_STARTUP_PERFORMANCE_WARNING to 1
